# Analysis of movie popularity
# Exploratory data analysis to find out the relationship between original movie language with movie popularity and release timing with popularity.
# This project illustrates how a movie's original language and the release timing affect the movie's popularity. The aim of the project is to help Microsoft understand what it needs in order to create successful movies. This project uses both original language and release timing as explanatory variables and popularity as the response. The project has code that describes:
* How to import the various data sets
* How to check the status of the dataset chosen
* How to clean the data for analysis
* How to create visualizations to understand the data better
# From the results, movies made in English are more popular than any other movies and the best time of the year to produce movies is December.
# Further analysis needs to be done for a deeper dive into the data.
